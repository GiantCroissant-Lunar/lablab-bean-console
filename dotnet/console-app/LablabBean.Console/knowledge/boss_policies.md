As a manager at Lablab Bean Coffee, you are responsible for creating an environment where employees thrive, customers are delighted, and the business succeeds. Leadership is about empowering your team, making sound decisions, and upholding our values.

## Core Management Principles

### 1. Lead by Example

- Model the behavior you expect from your team
- Maintain the highest standards of professionalism
- Show up with positive energy and enthusiasm
- Be the hardest worker in the room

### 2. Empower Your Team

- Trust employees to make decisions within their scope
- Provide clear guidance and support
- Encourage initiative and problem-solving
- Recognize and celebrate successes

### 3. Data-Driven Decisions

- Base decisions on facts, metrics, and evidence
- Track key performance indicators (KPIs)
- Analyze trends before making changes
- Balance intuition with objective analysis

### 4. Customer-First Mindset

- Every decision should consider customer impact
- Quality and service trump short-term cost savings

## Employee Management

### Hiring & Onboarding

- **Hiring Authority**: Managers can hire for open positions with HR approval
- **Interview Process**: Conduct structured interviews using standard questions
- **Background Checks**: Required for all hires (HR handles)
- **Onboarding**: Assign mentor, complete training checklist, check in after 30/60/90 days

### Performance Management

#### Regular Feedback

- Provide ongoing coaching and feedback
- Don't wait for formal reviews to address issues
- Balance constructive feedback with recognition
- Use specific examples, not generalizations

#### Formal Reviews

- Conduct quarterly performance reviews
- Use standardized review form (HR provides)
- Set measurable goals and development plans
- Document all reviews in personnel files

#### Performance Improvement Plans (PIPs)

**When to use:**

- Performance consistently below expectations
- Behavioral issues that haven't improved with coaching
- Skill gaps that need structured development

**Process:**

1. Document specific performance issues
2. Consult with HR before implementing
3. Create written plan with clear goals and timeline
4. Meet weekly to review progress
5. Provide resources and support to succeed

**Important**: PIPs are development tools, not termination procedures. Genuine effort should be made to help employee succeed.

### Disciplinary Actions

#### Progressive Discipline Framework

1. **Verbal Warning**: Informal coaching conversation (document in notes)
2. **Written Warning**: Formal warning letter, employee signature required
3. **Suspension**: Unpaid suspension (1-3 days) for serious issues
4. **Termination**: Final step after documented pattern

#### Immediate Termination Offenses

- Theft or fraud
- Violence or threats of violence
- Harassment or discrimination
- Intoxication on duty
- Willful destruction of property
- Revealing trade secrets or confidential information

**Always consult HR before terminating an employee.**

### Handling Employee Complaints

#### Your Response Protocol

1. **Listen without judgment** - give employee full attention
2. **Take notes** - document complaint details
3. **Ask clarifying questions** - ensure you understand fully
4. **Determine severity** - is this urgent/serious?
5. **Respond appropriately**:
   - Simple issue: Address immediately
   - Serious issue: Escalate to HR
   - Harassment/discrimination: Immediate HR escalation, mandatory
6. **Follow up** - ensure resolution and check on employee

#### Mandatory HR Escalation

- Harassment (sexual, racial, or any protected class)
- Discrimination claims
- Workplace safety violations
- Wage and hour disputes
- FMLA or ADA accommodation requests
- Retaliation claims

**Document everything. When in doubt, escalate to HR.**

## Scheduling & Labor Management

- **Notice required**: 4 hours before shift start when possible

## Customer Service Exceptions

### When You Can Exceed Standard Policy

- Exceptional circumstances (customer hardship, special occasion)
- Preventing loss of long-term customer relationship

### Exception Guidelines

- Use judgment based on customer lifetime value
- Document exceptions and reasoning
- Look for patterns that indicate policy needs updating
- Don't create precedents that can't be sustained

### The $100 Rule

You are empowered to spend up to $100 to resolve a customer issue without approval IF:

- You genuinely believe it's the right thing to do
- The customer has been wronged or disappointed
- Standard solutions aren't sufficient
- You can explain the reasoning afterward

**Trust your judgment. We'd rather keep a customer than save $100.**

## Crisis Management

### Level 1: Store-Level Issues

**You handle**: Equipment failure, staff shortage, customer complaints, minor injuries
**Action**: Use judgment, document incident, brief Regional Manager

### Level 2: Significant Issues

**Escalate to Regional Manager**: Major customer incidents, employee relations issues, serious safety concerns, PR-sensitive situations
**Action**: Immediate notification, detailed documentation

### Level 3: Critical Incidents

**Escalate to Emergency Line**: Serious injury, police involvement, media presence, threats, natural disasters
**Action**: Call emergency line immediately, then Regional Manager

### Media Inquiries

## Decision-Making Framework

When facing a difficult decision, ask:

1. **Is it legal?** (Consult HR/legal if unsure)
2. **Is it ethical?** (Does it align with our values?)
3. **Is it fair?** (Would I want this for myself?)
4. **Is it sustainable?** (Can we do this consistently?)
5. **What's the customer impact?** (Will this improve their experience?)
6. **What's the business impact?** (Does it make financial sense?)
7. **Can I explain it?** (Could I justify this to leadership?)

If you answer "yes" to all questions, proceed with confidence.

## Remember

**You're not alone.** Use your support system:

- Regional Manager - operational support and guidance
- HR - employee relations and compliance
- Operations Director - strategic decisions
- Peer managers - share best practices and advice

**Good judgment beats rigid rules.** These policies provide framework, but you're empowered to use discretion for the right outcomes.

**Take care of your people, and they'll take care of the business.** Invest in your team, and everything else follows.

**When in doubt, communicate up.** It's better to over-communicate than to surprise leadership with a problem.
